##Web Design Rules##

1. User-Centric Design

   • Always prioritize the needs and preferences of your users. Conduct user research to understand their behavior and preferences.

2. Visual Consistency

3. Clear Navigation

   • Ensure that users can easily find what they are looking for. Use a logical structure for menus and provide search functionality if necessary.
