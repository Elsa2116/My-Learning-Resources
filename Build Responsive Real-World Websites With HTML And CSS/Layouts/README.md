# CSS Layout Techniques

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to CSS layout techniques, including Floats, Flexbox, and Grid. These methods are essential for creating responsive and well-structured web designs.

## Layout Techniques

### 1. Floats
- **Overview**: Floats were one of the first techniques used for layout in CSS. They allow elements to be taken out of the normal document flow and positioned to the left or right of their container.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for text wrapping around images and creating simple column layouts.
- **Limitations**: Can lead to layout issues if not cleared properly.

### 2. Flexbox
- **Overview**: The Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox) is designed for one-dimensional layouts. It allows items within a container to be aligned and distributed efficiently.
- **Features**:
  - Align items vertically and horizontally.
  - Control the order of items without changing the HTML.
  - Create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Use Cases**: Navigation bars, card layouts, and any layout requiring alignment.

### 3. Grid
- **Overview**: CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for more complex designs. It enables you to create grid-based layouts with rows and columns.
- **Features**:
  - Define areas within the grid for placement of items.
  - Control both rows and columns simultaneously.
  - Create responsive designs with ease using grid templates.
- **Use Cases**: Web pages with multiple sections, dashboards, and complex layouts.
